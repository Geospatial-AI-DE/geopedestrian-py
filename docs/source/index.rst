Geospatial Pedestrian API Service
=================================
Solve walking scenarios and determine which places and areas are accessible by a pedestrian.

This modern Python module represents an idiomatic client accessing the `Geopedestrian location services <https://geospatial-ai.de/?rara-portfolio=geospatial-pedestrian-api-service>`__ being hosted on `Rapid API Hub <https://v2.rapidapi.com/gisfromscratch/api/geopedestrian>`__.

Why is it important?
--------------------
Solving walking scenarios and determining accessible places and areas for pedestrians is important for several reasons:

#. **Accessibility**:
   It helps identify areas that are easily accessible by foot, which is crucial for people who rely on walking as their primary mode of transportation. This includes people without access to personal vehicles, the elderly, and those with certain disabilities.

#. **Urban Planning**:
   It aids in urban planning and development. Understanding pedestrian accessibility can guide the placement of public facilities, parks, and businesses to ensure they are reachable for as many people as possible.

#. **Health and Environment**:
   Promoting walkability can lead to healthier lifestyles by encouraging physical activity. It also contributes to environmental sustainability by reducing reliance on motor vehicles, thereby decreasing carbon emissions.

#. **Safety**:
   By identifying and improving pedestrian routes, cities can enhance safety for pedestrians, reducing accidents and making the city safer for everyone.

#. **Tourism**:
   For tourists, understanding walkable areas can enhance their experience, allowing them to explore local attractions on foot.
   Location services contribute to making urban regions more livable, sustainable, and enjoyable. They are a vital tool in modern urban planning and development.
